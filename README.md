## General Information
- Simple grid layout with styled keys to indicate operators and other functions. 
- Delete key removes the trailing character until none remain, leaving the current value at 0. 
- Decimal key prevents multiple decimal presses if the current value already contains a decimal.
- As expected, the reset key creates a new interaction with the calculator. 
- On any operator press, the previous entry and operator selection is stored and displayed. 
- Upon equal operator use, the calculated value remains for further manipulation. 
- Theme slider to allow dark and light theme for added styling variety. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
